GitHub Actions is a platform that automates workflows directly within a GitHub repository. It enables developers to build, test, and deploy code, automating tasks such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Workflows are defined using YAML files and triggered by specific events like code pushes or pull requests.
